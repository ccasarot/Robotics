# Robotics
Project from the DTU course robotics 34753

Description

This repository contains the main project of the course "Robotics 34753" (DTU, fall semester). The report was developed in a team of 5 students, but the project itself was developed individually. 
The project is meant to create a code to control a 4 link robot. The matlab files created for this purpose space from direct and inverse kinematics to trajectory planning, force/inertia interaction and robot control. These match with the course topics, where the theory was applied each week in implementing part of the project.
